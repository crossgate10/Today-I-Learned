## Q:
```
How to writing Beautiful Packages in Go?
```

## A:
### *Motivation*
- Do you have the right motivation for writing a package?
- Don't write packages for the sake of it
- Are you excited to write it or does it sound boring?
- If you aren't solving a problem you have, don't bother
	
### *Keep packages internal to start with*
- Don't automatically open-source your packages
- Live with them first internally
- But design them as if you will use one day
### *What is a package / library ?*
- *Folder* full of `.go` (and hopefully `_test.go`) files
- Can be *imported* into other projects
- Has *exported* (public) and *unexported* (internal) stuff
- Hopefully open-sourced
- Not `package main` (that's a command)
###  *What is a beautiful package?*
- Elegant & simple
- Obvious (maybe even boring)
- You already know how to use it
- Look forward to using it
### *Structure your code properly*
- Subfolders
    - `cmd` - for commands
    - `pkg` - for package code
    - `testdata` - for, you guessed it, test data
    - `internal` - for internal stuff that only your code will import
    - `docs` - additional documentation
    - Be sensible
    
- Keep types close to where they're used
- Organise by responsibility (`User` tpe goes into `users.go`)
- Optimize for `godoc` and provide examples & use `godoc` early: `godoc -http=:8080`
### *How can we make our packages beautiful?*
- User centred design: Personas, Scenarios, Use cases
- Ask yourself...
	- Who is the user of the package?
	- What are they trying to do?
	- Why are they doing it?
	- Why are they using your package?
	- Are they building a PoC? Or is this part of a bigger system?
- Narrow types are simpler (be more abstract more you close user).
- Try and keep interface as tiny as possible if you need it (easy to implement).
- Context as the first argument
- Don't log stuff out
- Don't mess with the global state
	- Don't add flags
	- Avoid `init`
	- Don't mess with things in the standard library (e.g. changing `http.Defaultclient` to set a timeout)
	- Importing your package shouldn't have side-effects
- Leave concurrency to the user
- Test driven development
- Make zero values useful
- Avoid constructors if you can
- Use smaller APIs instead of interface
- Follow conventions
- Let computer help you
    - go lint
    - go vet

### *Come up with a good name*
- Short
- Clear
- To the point
- Be creative, and have fun
- Not every Go project needs to mention Go
### *Give your project a logo ormascot*
- Projects that have a logo, are 85% more likely to get used
- Great way for artists to contribute to open-source projects
